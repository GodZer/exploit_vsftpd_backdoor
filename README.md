# Rust exploit for vsftpd 2.3.4

The Rust code exploits the **CVE-2011-2523** which concerns the version 2.3.4 of vsftpd.

At first, it tries to log in with a username containing the `:)` smileyface and a random password. This appears to open a root backdoor on the port `6200` of the server.

This code was written to learn more about the vulnerability and the rust programming language.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo or create a new Rust project.
2. Build and run the code :

```shell
cargo build
cargo run <IP_ADDRESS>
```

The `<IP_ADDRESS>` is the IP address of the vulnerable vsftpd server.

## Issue
For the moment, the  `cp <pwd>` doesn't work on the created shell

## Test

You can test the exploit on [Metasploitable2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/)
